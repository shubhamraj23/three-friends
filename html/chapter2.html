                        Two years passed and it seemed as if Varun’s fears came true. Kavya and Shreya were in 
                        contact with each other, but there was absolutely no sign of Varun. They both were slowly 
                        beginning to forget him. Just when everything seemed to have ended between the three, time 
                        seemed to have some other plans for them.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        One fine morning, Shreya was sitting peacefully in her home, her cellphone rang; 
                        an unknown number was what it showed. She received the call.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Hello, am I speaking to Shreya?” said the voice on the other side.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Yes, may I know who is speaking,” she replied.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “You forgot me so quickly,” the voice replied.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Shreya though for a while and replied, “Yes, I am unable to recognise your voice.”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “We promised two years ago, on the day of farewell that we will never forget each other,” 
                        the voice replied.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        As soon as the voice spoke this, Shreya replied with amazement, “Varun, is it you speaking? 
                        How are you? Leave all that, first tell me where you were all this time?”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Varun replied, “I will tell you everything, first tell me how is Kavya?”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Shreya replied, “Kavya is absolutely fine. You neither spoke to me nor to her for the 
                        past two years. We thought that you had forgotten us. Just wait a minute; I will add 
                        Kavya on the call. Then let’s talk together.”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Shreya added Kavya on the call.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Hello Shreya, how are you?” said Kavya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        For a minute there was silence on the phone.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Shreya, are you there?” asked Kavya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Hi Kavya, how are you?” it was Varun spoke this time.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Varun, is this you?” Kavya was amazed to hear his voice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Yes, it is me,” replied Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “How are you?” asked Kavya. “And first of all, I am very angry with you. Where were you 
                        all these years? No contacts, nothing; you were the only one who wanted us to remain 
                        connected and you yourself forgot it,” she shouted.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “We won’t forgive you, Varun,” Shreya said.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Kavya also agreed positively and they both started mocking him. It seemed as if the old 
                        days had come back again, when they three used to talk, crack jokes and laugh without any 
                        worries.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “If your mocking is over, then can I say something,” said Varun with a gentle smile on 
                        his face.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Say whatever you have got to say in your defence,” said Shreya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Varun started his small story, “You both know this that I went away from our city, away 
                        from my parents as well. For the first one year, I didn’t have any personal phone. It was 
                        very difficult for me to contact my parents as well. I wanted to contact you, but I couldn’t. 
                        After one year, I had a personal cellphone with me. But, it was that very serious time, 
                        when studies became very important. I always remembered you, missed you as well. I just 
                        wanted to contact you anyhow, but neither had I your contact details nor had I the time 
                        to try searching for them. Now, after my exams got over, I struggled very hard, and somehow 
                        after so many days of searching for your contacts, I was successful.”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Feeling so sorry for you,” Shreya said.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Sorry, Varun. I should not have shouted at you like this. I didn’t know you were facing 
                        such a terrible situation in your life,” said Kavya in a low voice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Kavya, there is no need to say sorry for this. It’s not your fault. If there were 
                        someone else in you place he or she would have also said the same thing. In fact I am happy 
                        that you both didn’t forget me. Now, let’s forget all this; we three are back again,” 
                        said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Varun, you seemed to have changed. No more over thinking sort of stuff, and seeing the 
                        positive in everything,” said Shreya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Yes, it true,” said Varun happily. “It was Kavya actually who taught me all these things. 
                        And actually, they helped me a lot. It is all because of you that despite the difficult 
                        circumstances I was able to survive. Thank you so much!!”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Now no need to say thank you. I don’t think I did anything great for you but if it did 
                        help you, then you are most welcome,” said Kavya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “It is very good to see you back now, Varun. Now you always stay in contact with us. 
                        I will message you Kavya’s contact number and Kavya, I’ll message you Varun’s contact 
                        number,” said Shreya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Yeah, sure, I will remain in touch. Now, nobody can separate us,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Finally, after two long years, the three friends were back again. They were not at the 
                        same place, but they were together. Everything was going on nicely for the next few 
                        months. They were talking with each other nicely, cracking jokes, laughing wildly and 
                        enjoying their company, but it seemed as if life had different plans for them. Each one 
                        of the three had changed; they knew that they had changed, but were expecting the other 
                        to have remained the same. There were occasional misunderstandings between them which led 
                        to small fights between them. However, these fights didn’t last long because whenever there 
                        was a misunderstanding between any two of them, the third one was always there to clear 
                        and sort out the issue. The other two used to realise their mistake immediately, but still, 
                        the bond that they shared before seemed to have cracked a little bit.
