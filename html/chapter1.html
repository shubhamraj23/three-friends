                        It was the farewell ceremony of Class 10<sup>th</sup>, when everyone was enjoying, there was 
                        one person, Varun; who was sitting alone on the ground, in a corner, with his head down. 
                        He was deeply thinking about something, and tears were slowly flowing out from his eyes. 
                        The party was about to get over, and Varun had not been noticed by anyone for the last 20 
                        minutes. But, it wasn’t long until, Shreya; one of his closest friends noticed him.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Where have you been all the time, Varun?” asked Shreya. “The party is about to get over, 
                        everyone is looking for you, and here you are sitting in the corner,” she added.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        She looked at his eyes and was quite amazed to see tears flow out from them. “You are crying!” 
                        she exclaimed. “What happened to you? Is everything alright?” she asked.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “No, Shreya; I was just wondering about we three; Kavya, you and me. We have become so good 
                        friends over the past one year, and this farewell makes me think whether everything between 
                        us will remain the same after today or not,” said Varun sadly.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Listen, just don’t over think. We were best friends until now, and we will remain the same, 
                        forever,” said Shreya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Just at that very moment, Kavya noticed them, came to them and said, “Hey Shreya! Why did 
                        you suddenly come here? And Varun, where were you all this time? We had been searching out 
                        for you.” She, then, looked at his crying face and exclaimed with surprise, “Leave all that, 
                        first tell me why are you crying, Varun?”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Just because of his usual habit of over thinking,” Shreya said. “He doubts if our friendship 
                        will be able to continue from here on despite our distances.”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Come on Varun, we all three are friends for life. Nothing is going to change; it will remain 
                        the same forever. I promise,” said Kavya.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p id="main-text">
                        “I too promise,” said Shreya.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p id="main-text">
                        The smile was back on Varun’s face. With a cheerful smile he said, “I too promise.”
                    </p>
                    
                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Now come on, the party is about to be over. Let’s enjoy it now,” Kavya said to the other two.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p id="main-text">
                        “You both are the most precious gifts of God that I have ever received. Every time, whenever I 
                        am down, you both always come to my help. I am so blessed to have friends like you,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Same with both of us,” Kavya said cheerfully. “You need not mention this every time, and 
                        don’t ever think again that anything will happen to our friendship,” she added.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Varun grew a big smile on his face after hearing this. All three of them went together and
                        enjoyed the party. They were dancing and singing together in joy, screaming loudly along 
                        with the music tunes, to be followed with photo session of the entire batch of 2014, which 
                        was there together, for one last time, at least for the coming few years.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Now, the sad moment came where the three best friends had to part. Their ways were different 
                        from here onwards. Three people, three different choices and three different careers, became 
                        the reason for split between the three. They were all sad; they didn’t want to leave 
                        one-another and move forward; they knew that it would be very long after such a moment would 
                        repeat, but at the same time, there was one thing that gave them the confidence to move 
                        forward, and that was hope. There were tears in their eyes, but at the same time, their hopes 
                        to meet again soon stopped their tears from coming out. They all could sense the fear in 
                        Varun’s words, but at the same time they knew that their friendship was so strong that 
                        nothing could break it.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        The three of them, wished each other good luck for their journeys ahead and each one of them 
                        made a promise ‘We will be back soon.’ Their ways were different from here on; each one of 
                        them had a different journey ahead. Shreya decide to build her career in engineering, Kavya 
                        decided to opt a career in medical and Varun had the plans in his mind to be a successful 
                        entrepreneur. All three of them want to excel in their fields, but they wished more for the 
                        success of other two.
