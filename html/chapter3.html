                        One complete year had passed since they were back together. There were still frequent 
                        talks, group chats, and conference calls between the three; fights were easily cleared, 
                        but one person among the three seemed to be unhappy and that was Varun. His usual habit 
                        of over thinking was back again. After every fight, he used to think a lot about the issue 
                        which started causing him a lot of pain. He became the kind of person who started thinking 
                        that everything that happened was due to his fault. But the good thing was that he used to 
                        recover soon; usually by disappearing for a day or two and there coming back normally. 
                        Meanwhile, Kavya and Shreya were having their own issues between themselves, which used to 
                        close down and open up again suddenly. Things had changed for them; they were still best 
                        friends though; they still cared a lot for one-another; but the bond was weaker amongst them. 
                        They were fighting and sorting out issues, friendship was still going on well when life played 
                        its final big game on them.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        It was again a small fight between Varun and Kavya, which had been cleared out with the 
                        help of Shreya. Varun, with his usual habit of over thinking, started to think over the 
                        issue again and again and he disappeared again. The other two thought that he might have 
                        again disappeared for a day or two, as was his usual habit. But this time, it had gone 
                        longer. One week had passed and there was no sign of Varun. Kavya and Shreya were trying 
                        to call him, but he wasn’t receiving, texting him, but there was no reply from him. Kavya 
                        started to sense something wrong in all this; she started feeling as if it was due to their 
                        fight that he had disappeared and it was all her fault. Shreya kept on consoling her; it 
                        wasn’t due to their fight, he might be busy in some work. Shreya started talking to Kavya 
                        daily, so that she wouldn’t feel bad about this. Kavya also felt better every time she spoke 
                        to Shreya, but deep down in her heart, somewhere still she sensed that it was all her fault.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Ten days passed since Varun had disappeared. Kavya was at Shreya’s house. After three 
                        long years, the time had come when they both finally met each other again. But their 
                        joy wasn’t complete yet. They were deeply missing Varun; there were no signs of him yet. 
                        Suddenly Shreya’s cellphone rang, and to her delight it was Varun’s call. Kavya asked Shreya 
                        to answer it and keep the phone on speaker.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        As soon as Shreya lifted the call, Kavya said, “Varun, is everything alright? How are you? 
                        And where are you?”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Hi Kavya, seems that you both are together. Nice to see that after a long time, you both 
                        met each other,” said Varun in a very low voice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Yes Varun, and we are equally desperate to meet you as well,” said Shreya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        There was a small smile on the faces of Kavya and Shreya, but little did they know that 
                        it wouldn’t last long. While Shreya was speaking, Varun was continuously coughing and it 
                        was Kavya who noticed that first.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Varun, are you fine. You are coughing and that too badly. Is everything alright?” asked Kavya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “You are right, Kavya. I am in the hospital, lying on the bed,” said Varun slowly, 
                        again in the same low, monotonous voice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “What happened to you?” exclaimed both of them simultaneously.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Brain tumor, and it is cancerous in my case,” replied Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “What?” exclaimed both of them again simultaneously.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Yes, that day after our fight had been resolved; I decided not to talk for a while, 
                        and starting thinking over and over again about everything that had happened. As far 
                        as I remember, my head was aching badly, and after that I started feeling dizzy. I wasn’t 
                        able to breathe properly as well, and after that I collapsed. The next time when I got 
                        back to my senses, I was lying in the hospital with my mother in the front of me, crying. 
                        My father came to me and said me that I had a serious brain tumor, and it required operation, 
                        which took place the next day,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “So, now after the operation, are you fine?” asked Shreya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “No, the operation was unsuccessful,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        These words started echoing in their minds, especially Kavya; who started crying badly. 
                        Shreya was also in tears hearing this, but she had somehow controlled herself.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “I have got barely a few more days to survive now,” Varun added.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        They both were speechless. Various emotions were flowing through them. All their past 
                        memories were going through their mind. And it was heartbreaking for them to realise 
                        that such moments would never occur in their lives again.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Both of you stop crying and listen to me now,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        For some time, Shreya and Kavya stopped crying, thinking maybe this was the last time 
                        they were getting a chance to hear his voice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “I have a wish; my last wish, which you both have to fulfil. I want that after I 
                        leave, you both will never again fight with each other, for even the smallest of arguments, 
                        and will always stay as best friends. Three friends will be down to two friends, but these 
                        two will have to remain friends forever,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Varun was coughing badly. His condition was going on worse minute after minute. Kavya and 
                        Shreya were still depressed, various things were going through their minds, but they 
                        couldn’t speak anything. With a lot of courage, Shreya finally spoke something.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “I promise,” said Shreya. There was confidence in her voice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “And what about you Kavya?” asked Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        There was again silence. Kavya was still crying, and it seemed as if it would take her 
                        a lot of time to recover.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Kavya, do not cry. I know that you might be cursing yourself now. Look, this disease 
                        has got nothing to do with the fight that we had. Please stop crying, please Kavya,” 
                        said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        His words had had an effect on Kavya. She stopped crying and in a confident voice she 
                        said, “Yes, I too promise.”
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Good and you both please do not cry from now onwards. Just remember that all the 
                        moments that we had shared together were moments of fun. So, please just smile and live 
                        the remaining of your life happily,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “A friend allows you distance, but is never far away. Varun, we will always remember 
                        you,” said Kavya in a low voice.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “If lucky, I will call you both back again. Wish you both all the success in your life. 
                        Always stay happy and take care. Goodbye,” said Varun.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Thank you, Varun and Goodbye,” said Kavya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        “Goodbye Varun, you will be missed a lot,” said Shreya.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Such a moment had come in their lives where one was blessing the other two and the 
                        other couldn’t even wish for him. That was indeed the last time they heard his voice. 
                        The very next day, a small column in the newspaper informed them of his death. Kavya and 
                        Shreya were still depressed; they couldn’t believe what had just happened. And neither 
                        had they thought as well that their meeting after such a long time would give them such 
                        sad news. But they both made sure that his last dream was fulfilled. They were in continuous 
                        contact with each other, never fought with each other, helped each other a lot, and always 
                        remembered him as well. On the odd occasion, one of them would cry badly, missing him as 
                        hell, but there was always the second one for help.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        Years passed after that. Varun’s blessings had come true. They both became one of the most 
                        successful people in their respective fields; and had become role-models for people 
                        worldwide. They both credited all this to one man, and that was Varun, a tribute to him.
                    </p>

                    <p id="main-text">
                        13 years had passed since the day Varun had left. The batch of 2014 was back in the school 
                        in an alumni meet. Every single person from there batch had come there, except for one, 
                        who was being badly missed. The two friends were enjoying the party, but not fully; something, 
                        a big part of their lives was missing. The party was about to end; the time had come for a 
                        group photograph, but two people were missing. Kavya and Shreya were sitting on the ground, 
                        in a corner, with their heads down, crying slowly, at the same place where Varun sat and 
                        cried years ago.
